# Electric Skateboards, Bikes, and Scooters
Began creating electric vehicles in 2017 for personal use and science fair project (which 4th place in San Francisco). After safety concerns with skateboards, began building safer and more practical electric bikes able to conqure San Francisco hills. Reverse engineered proprietary Boosted electric scooter to create a more safe yet portable electric scooter.

### Details
- Role: Personal Project
- Dates: Summer 2017 - Present
- Vision: Create safe, affordable, and exhilarating electric vehicles for personal use.

### Goals
- Safe and reliable (controls and build)
- Affordable for a high school student budget
- Long range and steep hill climbing

## Notes
**Electric Skateboards:** First design used RC car brushless motors, two separate Li-Po battery packs, and a cheap dual motor esc. While this did the job, it was heavy, bulky, and unreliable. This was changed in the second version which used programmable VESCs, a custom battery, and a professional grade remote and reciever for smoother and more reliable ride.

**Electric Bikes:** First design used a 1000w motor and a few 37v RC Li-Po batteries with a bms. This was much more reliable and comfortable than the skateboards and easy to charge with the addition of a bms. When making the second bike, a newer more stable bike frame was chosen to accomodate a 1500w motor and a 58v lithium ion battery pack. This was even more powerful and used often to tour around San Francisco.

**Electric Scooter:** First steps were attempting to as many original components as possible. Careful research, electrical analysis, and experimentation revealed that a proprietary battery and controller must be used together. Working backwards, it was decided to use the original throttle and motors and replace the controller and battery. By selling the original controller, a larger battery pack and high quality VESCs were used to create a longer range and more reliable scooter than the original.
