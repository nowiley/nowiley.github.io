# Maker Projects
A collection of past and present projects. Noah started making because of my favoirte childhood TV show, How it's Made.

Early projects include building a desktop computer and MIDI controller. Noah became increasingly interested in electronics and the physical aspect of creating and explored 3D design using Fusion 360 and 3D printing.

Later he began building small EVs using high power remote control car/airplane components and progressed to more complex EVs like a UTV. Recently, Noah excitedly pursues coursework, projects, and research in autonomus vehicles, AI, and wireless systems.
