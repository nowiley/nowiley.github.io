## Design and Process
**First Steps:** Identify needs of the project like voltage, current, capacity, physical size, environment, and budget. Research cells and BMSs that meet these needs; often using second hand cells from laptops, EVs, and power tools.

**Assembly:** Temporarily connect all cells in parallel to balance voltages. Disconnect and spot weld cells in individual parallel groups. Carefully connect groups in series, test voltages, and hook up BMS balancing leads. Attach charging port, discharge leads, and temperature sensors. Test pack and enjoy!
